# Chatbot-for-Business-and-Education-using-Embeddings-and-Transformers
A powerful chatbot ðŸ¤– for business and education purposes that uses embeddings and transformers to provide accurate and personalized responses, enhancing user experiences. Customizable and adaptable, it leverages NLP techniques to automate tasks, offer guidance, and streamline processes.
 The project is a conversational chatbot specifically developed for business and educational purposes. It leverages the power of embeddings and transformers to deliver highly accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries. By incorporating advanced natural language processing techniques, the chatbot enables seamless interaction with users, providing them with real-time information and assistance.

With a focus on enhancing the user experience, the chatbot offers prompt and precise answers to frequently asked questions, as well as tailored responses to specific inquiries. It serves as a virtual assistant, capable of understanding and addressing a wide range of topics related to the business or educational domain.

One of the key advantages of this project is its ability to be customized and trained using domain-specific data. This allows businesses and educational institutions to fine-tune the chatbot according to their specific needs and requirements. By incorporating their own data, they can create a more personalized and effective conversational experience for their users.

The chatbot's underlying technology utilizes embeddings, which capture the semantic representation of text, enabling a deeper understanding of user queries. This, combined with transformers, enables the chatbot to generate contextually appropriate responses with a high degree of accuracy. The model continuously learns and adapts from user interactions, improving its performance over time.

In a business context, the chatbot can serve as an efficient customer support tool, providing instant responses to common inquiries and guiding users through various processes. It can also act as a virtual assistant, assisting with tasks such as appointment scheduling, order tracking, and product recommendations.

In the education sector, the chatbot can support students by answering their questions, providing study materials, and offering guidance on educational pathways. It can assist educators by automating administrative tasks, delivering relevant educational resources, and facilitating online learning experiences.

The code is a conversational chatbot program that allows users to ask questions and receive responses. Let's go through the code step by step:

First, the necessary libraries are imported, including os for system operations, openai for interaction with the OpenAI API, llama_index for indexing and searching text, langchain for chat models, and textwrap for text formatting.

Next, the required packages are installed using the pip install commands. These packages include PyPDF2 for working with PDF files, openai for the OpenAI API, langchain for language models, and llama-index for text indexing.

The OpenAI API key is configured by setting it as an environment variable. Make sure to replace the placeholder key with your own API key.

The code reads PDF files from a folder named "datos" using the SimpleDirectoryReader from llama_index. The data is loaded and stored in the variable called "pdf".

A chat model is defined and instantiated using the LLMPredictor from llama_index. The specific model used is ChatOpenAI with a temperature of 0 and the model name 'gpt-3.5-turbo'. It is assigned to the variable "modelo".

The content of the PDF files is indexed using the GPTVectorStoreIndex from llama_index. The index is created based on the loaded PDF documents and stored in the variable "index".

Optionally, the index can be saved to disk using the save_to_disk() method. This allows the index to be reused without repeating the indexing process.

Optionally, the index can be loaded from disk using the load_from_disk() method. This is useful if the index was previously saved and needs to be reused.

The program enters a main loop where it continuously prompts the user to input a question.

The user's question is concatenated with the string "Responde en espaÃ±ol" (Respond in Spanish).

The index is used to search for the entered question using the as_query_engine().query(pregunta) method. The response is stored in the variable "respuesta".

The response is wrapped into lines of a maximum of 100 characters using the textwrap.wrap() function.

Each line of the response is printed on the console.

The code essentially sets up a chatbot that utilizes a pre-trained language model to provide responses based on user questions. It demonstrates the process of importing libraries, installing packages, configuring the API key, reading PDF files, defining the chat model, indexing the content, and interacting with the user.
